This is a sampe text file.

# Instructions:
# Using your favorite text editor, create a text file called sample.txt,
# write a short message in it, and save it to the repository directory.

# New Instructions:
# Change the text in the file, then at the bottom of the screen enter a
# commit message in the first field of the Commit Changes box.
# Then, Click the Commit Changes button at the bottom of the screen.

# Even More Instructions
